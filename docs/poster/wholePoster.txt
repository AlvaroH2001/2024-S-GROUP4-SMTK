SmallTalk

Connecting Young Patients through Secure, Supportive Communication

Background

The Problem

Children undergoing medical treatment often experience  feelings of loneliness and isolation during their hospital stays. Separated from their usual social circles and facing unique health challenges, these young patients seek connection, understanding, and support.

Inspired by the personal experience of a member of our development team, who struggled with isolation while undergoing treatment for aplastic anemia.


Research collectively points towards a significant gap in pediatric healthcare: the lack of a dedicated platform for young patients to connect, share, and find solace.

SmallTalk seeks to mitigate the feelings of isolation, inadequate care coordination, and the lack of engaging communication tools in hospital settings, thereby improving the overall hospital experience for children.


The application features customizable user profiles, illness-specific chat rooms, integrated options for playing games and watching movies together, and in-app food ordering.

Our Solution

SmallTalk provides a safe and interactive platform where children in hospitals can connect with peers facing similar health journeys. By fostering friendships, sharing experiences, and offering personalized support, SmallTalk aims to brighten the hospital experience and bring smiles to young faces.
